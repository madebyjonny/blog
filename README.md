# Personal blog

My blog is using Astro along side Keystatic.

## Running the blog

Install the dependencies with `npm install`

run the app with `npm run dev`

to access the CMS once the app is running go to `localhost:4321/keystatic`

### Using Prettier

You may need to add the below to your vs code settings

```
"prettier.documentSelectors": ["**/*.astro"],
  "[astro]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  },
```
